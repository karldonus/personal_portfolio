<ul>Karl grew up as the youngest of five children in a century-old log cabin only a stone's throw from the White House.</ul>
<ul>He was the first man to graduate from his Alma mater - a former women's college.</ul>
<ul>In college, Karl became a serial entrepreneur. He co-founded a number of sustainable initatives to include a bike share program, fair-trade cafe, inner-city orchard/poultry program, eco-friendly laundry detergent business, among other things. His goal was to make everyday people's lives just a little better, just a little easier. Through Karl's and his Belgian best friend's efforts, Randolph College is now ranked in the Top 50 Green schools in the US.</ul>
<ul>Afterward, Karl did a brief stint for the Shanghainese Energizer Bunny as a marketing intern.</ul>
<ul>For the subsequent three years, he channeled his inner-Mad Max road warrior as a university admissions counselor. So far, Karl's traveled to forty-seven states in the good ol' US of A. </ul>
<ul>While finishing up his MBA at Lynchburg College, Karl helped expand his brother's digital marketing consulting startup to land clients as far flung as Sydney and Moscow. </ul>
<ul>Karl spent the past eight months behind the Great Firewall of China to improve his chopstick skills (under the guise of expanding his market research startup). After a gnarly motorcycle accident breaking his leg in the middle-of-nowhere, Indonesia, Karl returned to the States.</ul>
<ul>Now, Karl's switching careers to web development. He might be no Al Gore - Inventor of the Interwebs - but Karl's certainly going to give it a good shot.</ul>
<ul>Why the switch? In Shanghai, dozens of cranes dot the Chinese skyline. However, the masses weren't peering upward, but rather downward at their mobile devices. That level of interconnectivity dwarfed the West. WeChat, Alibaba, Weibo - all web-based solutions helping making over a billion people with their daily lives. Karl was inspired. By learning programming, Karl hopes to contribute to making people's lives a little better, a little easier on a potentially a global scale.</ul>
